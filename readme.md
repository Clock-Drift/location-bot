# Location Bot
This simple app will quickly update your status to show which site you are at without having to change it manually in your profile.

Simply type `/location` and then your building code, for example "pr" for Peckham Road and "hh" for High Holborn.

The app also supports common mistyped names like "lcc" for Elephant & Castle and "wimbledon" for Merton Hall Road.
